# Steps for Snork encryption:
# 1) Replace all instances of "a" with the length of the sentence
# 2) Replace all instances of "e" with the length of the sentence + 1
# 3) Replace all instances of "i" with the lenght of the sentence + 2
# 4) Replace all instances of "o" with the lenght of the sentence + 3
# 5) Replace all instances of "u" with the lenght of the sentence + 4

print "Please enter a sentence:",
sentence = raw_input()
length = len(sentence);
encrypted = sentence.replace("a", str(length));
encrypted = sentence.replace("e", str(length+1));
encrypted = sentence.replace("i", str(length+2));
encrypted = sentence.replace("o", str(length+3));
encrypted = sentence.replace("u", str(length+4));
print "The encrypted sentence is %s" % encrypted
decrypted = encrypted.replace(str(length), "a");
decrypted = decrypted.replace(str(length+1), "e");
decrypted = decrypted.replace(str(length+2), "i");
decrypted = decrypted.replace(str(length+3), "o");
decrypted = decrypted.replace(str(length+4), "u");
print "The decrypted sentence is %s" % decrypted
